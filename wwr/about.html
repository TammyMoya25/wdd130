            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Rapid Travel Adventures was founded in 2012 by a small group of outdoor enthusiasts who shared a love for
                rafting,
                travel, and conservation. What began as weekend trips along local rivers quickly grew into a full-scale
                adventure
                company dedicated to creating authentic, adrenaline-filled experiences around the world. Over the years,
                Rapid Travel
                Adventures has expanded from a single base in Colorado to multiple destinations across North and Central
                America,
                offering guided rafting expeditions through some of the most breathtaking white-water routes. Despite
                its growth, the
                company has stayed true to its roots — promoting environmental stewardship, cultural respect, and the
                belief that every
                journey down the river is a journey toward self-discovery.</p>
