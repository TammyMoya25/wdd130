        <p>Hi! This is me. I am Tamara from Costa Rica. I married my best friend 3 months ago at Costa Rica's temple,
            here we are at this picture. I love programming, playing the piano and watching movies. It's nice to meet
            you!</p>

        <p>Costa Rica is a natural haven with stunning beaches, rainforests, and active volcanoes. It is renowned for
            its
            biodiversity, "pura vida" people, and environmental awareness. It's an ideal destination for both
            adventurers and lovers
            of nature.</p>
